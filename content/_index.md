I am a statistician at [Merck](https://www.merck.com/) 
and enjoy clinical trial development.

My current focus is on using **R** to fill process, technical and training gaps 
for clinical trial analysis, reporting, and submission with 
a group of talented members within Merck and across the pharmaceutical industry.  
Our recommendations are summarized in <https://r4csr.org/>. 

My current interests in statistical methods include 
study design, missing data, and survival analysis.  

I earned my PhD degree in biostatistics from New York University.
My thesis focused on developing statistical methods to evaluate 
prognostic accuracy in survival analysis and longitudinal microbiome data, advised by
[Yongzhao Shao](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/yongzhao-shao) and [Huilin Li](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/huilin-li).
